# About me
## My Interests/Hobbies
1. **Cooking**  
Cooking has been my favorite hobby which I have actively engaged in from a young age.
My interest in cooking stemmed from helping my parents with simple tasks in the kitchen and watching cooking shows.  
I also enjoy baking; my favorite thing to make is a Crème brûlée.
2. **History**  
History has always been my favorite school subject to study.  
I especially find the ascpect of changes in national borders interesting to research.  
My favorite part of history to study is WW1 and WW2.
3. **Swimming**  
This was my favorite sport to play throughout highschool.  
I found it to be a great form of exercise that works out your whole body; I continue swimming to this day.
4. **Coin Collecting**
This was a hobby I picked up at a very young age.
I have collected a variety of rare coins, ranging from ancient coins to more modern memorial coins.
